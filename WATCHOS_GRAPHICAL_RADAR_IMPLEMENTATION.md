# watchOS Graphical Radar Implementation Summary

## ✅ Implementation Complete

The watchOS app has been upgraded from a text-based radar to a **full graphical radar** matching the Wear OS design.

---

## 📋 Changes Made

### Phase 1: Data Model Extension
**File:** `WatchConnectivityManager.swift`

- ✅ Added `AllyBlip` struct to represent ally positions
  - `d`: Distance in meters (0-30m)
  - `b`: Relative bearing in degrees (-180 to 180)
  - `allyId`: Player ID (first 4 characters)

- ✅ Extended `SnapshotNearby` to include `allies: [AllyBlip]?` array

### Phase 2: Graphical Radar Components
**File:** `GraphicalRadarView.swift` (NEW)

- ✅ **GraphicalRadarView**: Main radar view displaying allies as dots
- ✅ **RadarBackground**: Renders concentric circles (10m, 20m, 30m), crosshairs, and north indicator
- ✅ **AllyDot**: Individual ally dot with position calculation
  - Converts bearing/distance to screen coordinates
  - Shows team-colored dots (cyan for police, red for thieves)
  - Includes shadow/glow effect

### Phase 3: UI Update
**File:** `ContentView.swift`

- ✅ Replaced text-based `InGameRadarView` with graphical version
  - Shows graphical radar (120pt height)
  - Displays connection status and heart rate
  - Shows danger pill for thieves when enemy is near
  - Shows remaining time
  - Skill button overlay in bottom-right corner

### Phase 4: Tab Structure Optimization
**File:** `ContentView.swift`

- ✅ Reduced from **4 tabs → 3 tabs**:
  1. **Radar**: Graphical radar (main view)
  2. **Status**: Combined stats (team counts, captures/rescues, distance)
  3. **Rules**: Game rules

- ✅ Added new views:
  - `InGameStatusView`: Unified status display
  - `InGameRulesView`: Rules display
  - `HeartRatePill`: Heart rate display component
  - `SkillButtonOverlay`: Skill button component
  - `StatItem`: Stat display card component

## 🎯 Coordinate Transform Formula

Flutter sends ally positions with:
- `d`: Distance (0-30 meters)
- `b`: Relative bearing (-180° to +180°, 0° = forward)

watchOS converts to screen coordinates:
```swift
let theta = (b - 90) * (.pi / 180)  // Adjust so 12 o'clock = 0°
let r = radius * (d / 30.0)         // Normalize to screen radius
let x = center.x + r * cos(theta)
let y = center.y + r * sin(theta)
```

## ✅ Verification Checklist

### Data Flow
- [x] Flutter sends `allies` array in `STATE_SNAPSHOT` messages
- [x] watchOS decodes `AllyBlip` array from `nearby.allies`

### Graphical Radar
- [ ] Concentric circles display at 10m, 20m, 30m
- [ ] Crosshairs and north indicator visible
- [ ] Ally dots appear at correct positions
- [ ] Police team shows cyan dots
- [ ] Thief team shows red dots
- [ ] Dots update in real-time as players move

### UI Features
- [ ] Heart rate displays when available
- [ ] Danger pill shows for thieves when enemy near
- [ ] Skill button appears and works
- [ ] Remaining time displays correctly

### Tab Structure
- [ ] 3 tabs present (Radar/Status/Rules)
- [ ] Phone tab changes sync to watch
- [ ] Watch tab gestures work

## 🚀 Testing Instructions

1. **Build and Run**:
   ```bash
   # From frontend/ directory
   make run-ios
   # Select watchOS simulator from Xcode
   ```

2. **Test Scenarios**:
   - Create/join a room on phone
   - Select team and ready up
   - Start match with multiple players
   - Move around to see ally positions update on watch radar
   - Verify dots appear at correct distances and bearings
   - Test skill button activation
   - Swipe between tabs on watch

3. **Verify Radar Accuracy**:
   - Stand next to ally (< 5m): dot should be near center
   - Ally at 15m: dot should be on middle circle
   - Ally at 30m: dot should be on outer circle
   - Ally directly ahead: dot should be at 12 o'clock
   - Ally to right: dot should be at 3 o'clock

## 📁 Modified Files

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `WatchConnectivityManager.swift` | Added `AllyBlip`, extended `SnapshotNearby` |
| `GraphicalRadarView.swift` | **NEW** - Full graphical radar implementation |
| `ContentView.swift` | Updated `InGameRadarView`, restructured tabs, added components |

## 🔧 Technical Notes

- **Auto-Build**: Xcode 15+ uses `PBXFileSystemSynchronizedRootGroup`, so new files are auto-included
- **No Manual Project Changes Needed**: Just build and run
- **Team Colors**:
  - Police: `.cyan` (#00FFFF)
  - Thief: `.red` (#FF0000)
- **Radar Range**: 30 meters (matches Flutter implementation)
- **Update Frequency**: Real-time via WebSocket `STATE_SNAPSHOT` messages

---

## 🐛 Known Issues / Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add distance labels on concentric circles (10m, 20m, 30m)
- [ ] Add compass rose (N/S/E/W markers)
- [ ] Animate ally dot movements for smoother transitions
- [ ] Add ally player IDs/names on tap
- [ ] Add zoom control for different radar ranges
- [ ] Add haptic feedback when ally enters close range

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check Flutter is sending `allies` array (add debug logs in `state_snapshot_builder.dart`)
2. Verify watchOS receives data (add print statements in `WatchConnectivityManager.swift`)
3. Check Xcode console for Swift compile errors
4. Ensure watch is paired and reachable from phone
